<h4>Fiordland Current</h4>
<p>
The Fiordland Current is a poleward-flowing EBC along the Fiordland coast of southwest New Zealand. Satellite altimetry was used to estimate the mean, interannual variability, decadal variability, and longer-term trends in the across-track surface geostrophic velocity of the current. Possible drivers of trends and variability were identified. A paper has been <a href="https://mlchandler.github.io/publications/">published</a> on this work.
