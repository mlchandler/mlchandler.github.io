<h4>Argo and HR-XBT Observing Networks</h4>
<p>
This project aims to combine complementary Argo and HR-XBT datasets to improve long-term estimates of mass and heat transport in both the ocean's interior and boundary currents and is based on the work by <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0153.1">Zilberman et al. 2018</a>.

A poster on this work was presented at <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/osm20/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/653466">Ocean Sciences Meeting 2020</a> in San Diego, and a pdf of the poster can be viewed <a href="Chandler_OSM_poster_draft_final.pdf">here</a>.

<h4>Fiordland Current</h4>
<p>
The Fiordland Current is a poleward-flowing EBC along the southwest coast of New Zealand. Satellite altimetry was used to estimate the mean, interannual variability, decadal variability, and longer-term trends in the across-track surface geostrophic velocity of the current. Possible drivers of trends and variability were identified. A <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/10.1080/00288330.2019.1629467">paper</a> has been published on this work.
