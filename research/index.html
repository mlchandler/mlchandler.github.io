<p>
This project builds on work by <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0153.1">Zilberman et al. 2018</a> and aims to combine complementary Argo and HR-XBT datasets to improve long-term estimates of mass and heat transport in boundary current regions and in the ocean's interior.

<h4>Fiordland Current</h4>

<p>
The Fiordland Current is a poleward-flowing eastern boundary current (EBC) along the southwest coast of New Zealand. Satellite altimetry was used to estimate the mean, interannual variability, decadal variability, and longer-term trends in the across-track surface geostrophic velocity of the current. Variability and trends in the current were related to possible drivers.
